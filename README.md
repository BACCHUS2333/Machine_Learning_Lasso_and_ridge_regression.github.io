# Lasso and Ridge Regression with Cross Validation
This repository contains Python scripts for implementing Lasso and Ridge regression models using k-fold and leave-one-out cross validation techniques.

## Overview
Lasso and Ridge regression are powerful techniques used for regularization in linear regression models. They help prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms to the regression coefficients. This repository provides implementations of both Lasso and Ridge regression models using cross validation for optimal hyperparameter tuning.

## Contents
lasso_regression.py: Python script for implementing Lasso regression with k-fold and leave-one-out cross validation.
ridge_regression.py: Python script for implementing Ridge regression with k-fold and leave-one-out cross validation.
data/: Directory containing sample datasets for testing the models.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the repository and instructions for usage.

### Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
SciPy
scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lasso-ridge-regression.git
Navigate to the repository directory:

bash
Copy code
cd lasso-ridge-regression
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the desired script (lasso_regression.py or ridge_regression.py) providing the dataset path and optional arguments for cross validation:

css
Copy code
python lasso_regression.py --dataset path/to/dataset.csv --k_folds 5
css
Copy code
python ridge_regression.py --dataset path/to/dataset.csv --leave_one_out
Dataset Format
The dataset should be provided in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format with the target variable in the last column and features in preceding columns. Each row represents a data point, and columns represent features.
